gotk3_tkix: A simple game where you try to catch the bouncing
"TKix" by grabbing both ends with a movable black box.

Move the box with the arrow keys. The TKix moves a little faster when 
you are moving the box. You can also use the "space" to make the TKix 
move faster. Once you have caught the "TKix" you can release it by 
moving the box. A new TKix is then released. Each new TKix moves
faster than the one before. 

At level 10 and above the ends of the TKix will move faster than you 
can move the box, so you have to predict where the TKix is going in
order to catch it. 

Written in Go and uses the GTK3 library.
